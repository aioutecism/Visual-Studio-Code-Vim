## Contributing

Feel free to open [issues][] to report bugs or require features.

[Pull requests][] are welcomed too! See VS Code's official instructions about:

- [How to run and debug extensions][]
- [How to run extension tests][]
  - Protip: change `suite(` to `suite.only(` in a test file to run only a
    single test suite at a time. This saves quite a lot of time. Remember to
    remove the `.only` part before making a Git commit.
